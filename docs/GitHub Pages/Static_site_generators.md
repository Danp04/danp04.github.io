## What is Jekyll?
*Jekyll* is a free of charge open source static site generator and a functionality of the GitHub Pages service. Jekyll simply works by applying content of your files created in Markdown to pre-defined tags. As a result, you obtain a website that can be published by any web server. Thus, you can easily manage your projects and focus more on content.

üí° Jekyll is integrated with GitHub for generating GitHub Pages without the need to install Jekyll on your computer.

## How to create a Github Pages site using Jekyll?
### Getting started


1. Open the previously created file *index.html* and rename it into index.md to start working in Markdown.
2. Add content written in Markdown.

   ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip**: If you already have a markdown file, copy its content to *index.md*
3. In Github Desktop Client fill in the **Summary** box and perform the standard procedure:
-   **Commit to master**
-   **Push origin**

3. In the server as you sign in to GitHub.com you can see your changed file.
   **üìù Note:** the file *index.md* is your starting point for the formation of the web page.

### Configuring Jekyll
To start working with Jekyll you need to use appropriate template named just-the-docs. You can fully use it only when you make a copy to your repository.

To copy just-the-docs template to your repository follow the steps below:
1. In the top left corner on Github.com search for *just-the-docs* repository and open it.

   ![S13](../../assets/images/screen_13.jpg)
-  **Clone**

   **üìù Note:** It is recommended to use the shortest path, for example *C: Git/just-the-docs*, as the repository is to be created inside the folder you selected for your local path.

4. Select the option **For my own purposes** when the notification appears.
